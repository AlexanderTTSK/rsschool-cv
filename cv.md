My goal is the constant development and study of information. At this stage, my area of interest has shifted to IT technology.
In particular, I would like to be engaged in front-end development. 
My strengths are patience, learning ability, and focus on results. Unfortunately at this stage I have no experience in development, but I hope that soon it will appear.
